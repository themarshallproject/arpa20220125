      How much Detroit defenders get paid
    </p>
    <p class="graphic-deck-sidebar">
      Court-appointed defense attorneys in Detroit do not receive a salary or hourly wages. Instead, they are paid per court "event." Some events that take less preparation, like an arraignment, pay nearly as much as ones that take days or weeks of work, such as a trial. Here is the fee schedule for cases that could result in a potential sentence of 24 to 60 months in prison.
