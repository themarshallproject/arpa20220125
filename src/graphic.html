<p><strong>Proposition 17</strong> <span data-status="passed" class="g-elex-status"></span></p>

<p>California currently restores the right to vote when someone is released from prison and completes parole. <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=17&amp;year=2020">Proposition 17</a>, which has Gov. Gavin Newsom’s support, would allow people still on parole to vote and to <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/06/23/formerly-incarcerated-political-candidates">run for office</a>. <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx">Sixteen other states</a> currently allow people to vote as soon as they’re released from prison; people can vote while still incarcerated in D.C., <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/06/11/in-just-two-states-all-prisoners-can-vote-here-s-why-few-do">Maine and Vermont</a>. —<em>Christie Thompson</em></p>

<p><strong>Proposition 20</strong> <span data-status="failed" class="g-elex-status"></span></p>

<p>After decades of “tough-on-crime” policies, California voters recently passed a series of measures aimed at reducing the number of people behind bars. Voters supported <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-parole-board-proposition-57-20170727-htmlstory.html">efforts to allow incarcerated people a chance at earlier release</a> and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11796149/voter-approved-criminal-justice-reform-expected-to-save-state-over-122-million">to reduce penalties for some lower-level crimes</a>. If Proposition 20 passes, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercurynews.com%2F2020%2F10%2F17%2Fproposition-20-will-california-go-back-to-its-tough-on-crime-past%2F%3FclearUserState%3Dtrue">it could signal a shift in the other direction</a>. </p>

<p>Supporters of the measure, including conservative prosecutors and law enforcement unions, say the previous changes went too far, setting off a spree of shoplifting and other crimes. They want more crimes added to a list of “violent felonies” and argue that the threshold for felony shoplifting is too high, among other changes. </p>

<p>Those opposed, including the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-southern-california-proposition-endorsements-2020-election">ACLU</a>, Gov. Newsom and the state’s Democratic Party, say that years of harsh penalties fueled mass incarceration, leading to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24scotus.html">dangerous prison overcrowding</a> and racial disparities. “For years, California has proudly led the way on fundamental civil rights and criminal justice reform but, as we’ve witnessed first hand across our country, there’s more we must do to root out racial inequity and structural bias and to embrace proven reforms that work,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/25/newsom-urges-no-on-sentencing-rollback-supports-affirmative-action-1312341">Newsom said in a statement</a>. — <em>Abbie VanSickle</em></p>

<p><strong>Proposition 25</strong> <span data-status="undecided" class="g-elex-status"></span></p>



<p>If voters pass Proposition 25, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/28/gov-brown-signs-bill-eliminating-money-bail-in-california/">a 2018 law aimed at eliminating cash bail</a> will go into effect. That law sought to replace the current system—where people pay money to get out of jail while awaiting trial <a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/pretrial-risk-assessment-in-california.pdf">by using algorithms to assess whether people are at risk</a> of committing another crime or failing to show up for court. </p>

<p>Proponents of the law, including <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-14/california-voters-referendum-end-cash-bail-system-proposition-25">Gov. Gavin Newsom</a> and the <a href="https://cadem.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/State-Propositions-on-the-2020-November-Ballot-.pdf">California Democratic Party</a>, say it’s a good step toward fixing an unfair system. Under cash bail, wealthy people can get out of jail before trial, they argue, allowing the rich more time to prepare their cases and to keep jobs, housing and families intact. People who can’t afford to pay their way out of jail are stuck until pleading out or going to trial. </p>

<p>The law <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/08/30/so-much-for-the-great-california-bail-celebration">caused a stir</a> among both the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-bail-industry-makes-itself-invisible-15588602.php">commercial bail industry</a> and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11841209/proposition-25-would-end-cash-bail-so-why-are-some-progressive-groups-against-it">some progressive groups</a>, for very different reasons. Bail companies say the current system works fine, <a href="https://www.allprobailbond.com/blog/news/sb-10-bad-california/">raising concerns that crime may go up</a> if the law goes into effect. Some criminal justice advocacy organizations, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/08/human-rights-ballot-california#">Human Rights Watch</a>, oppose the law. These groups worry the new law could lead to greater racial disparities because of concerns about <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/07/01/can-racist-algorithms-be-fixed">flaws in risk assessment algorithms</a> and give too much power to judges. These advocates don’t like cash bail, but they don’t like the 2018 law either. </p>

<span class="shortcode-subhead">KENTUCKY <span data-status="passed" class="g-elex-status"></span></span>
 </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2020/10/14/marsys-law-is-back-on-the-ballot-in-kentucky/">Voters in Kentucky will decide</a> whether to pass Amendment 1, a victims’ rights amendment more commonly known as Marsy’s Law. The measure is named for Marsalee Nicholas, a young California woman killed by her boyfriend in 1983. Her brother, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/22/nicholas-law">tech billionaire</a> Henry Nicholas, founded and almost single handedly bankrolls a national organization to add the measure to state constitutions around the country. It has already done so in 11 other states.</p>

<p>These measures vary from state to state, but generally add constitutional protections to existing state guarantees that victims or their families are consulted and notified at key steps in the criminal justice process. Controversially, in some states, the measures even grant victims the right to have their names withheld from public documents and deny defendants access to certain evidence in their case. This can make it hard for a defendant to research their case, make a decision about a plea deal, or plan their defense.</p>

<p>The Kentucky measure, like most of the others, gives victims legal standing in court, allowing them to ask a judge to step in if they feel they’ve been denied their rights. Defense attorneys and other c<a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/12/marsys-law-protections-for-crime-victims-sound-great-but-could-cause-problems">ritics</a> <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/12/marsys-law-protections-for-crime-victims-sound-great-but-could-cause-problems">say</a> the measure turns the criminal justice process on its head, designating a victim before a judge or jury has heard any facts or even determined whether a crime has taken place. Kentucky leaves the definition of “victim” to the legislature, but who qualifies for protection has been a sticky issue; in both North and South Dakota, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/columnists/stu-whitney/2018/10/19/whitney-marsys-law-protection-police-officers-say-aint-so/1675738002/">police who shot civilians</a> have <a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/crime-and-courts/4475423-marsys-law-often-invoked-withhold-officers-names">had their names withheld</a> from news reports, claiming they were victims under Marsy’s Law. </p>

<p>The measure has been challenged in court in a handful of states—lawsuits are pending in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/10/Pennsylvania-Commonwealth-Court-panel-hears-argument-Marsys-Law-victims-rights/stories/202006100112">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2020/07/01/back-in-the-news-suit-challenges-marsys-law-amendment/">Wisconsin</a>—but in general the national organization’s generous funding stream, paired with public sympathy for crime victims, makes the measure’s success in The Bluegrass State almost certainly assured. It already passed once, in 2018, but the state Supreme Court threw out the election results because the measure’s language was too vague. —<em>Beth Schwartzapfel</em></p>

<span class="shortcode-subhead">MICHIGAN <span data-status="undecided" class="g-elex-status"></span></span>


<p><a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/election-2020-heres-what-you-need-know-about-proposal-2">Michigan’s Proposal 2</a>  would update existing constitutional protections against warrantless search and seizure to explicitly include electronic data and communications. Under current language, crafted long before the advent of digital technology, “a person, house, papers or possessions” are secure from search without a warrant and probable cause. The update would be consistent with the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sclaw/SupremeCourt_Riley.pdf">Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Riley v. California</a>, which held that generally police must first obtain a warrant before searching an arrested person’s cell phone. </p>

<p>There has been no vocal opposition to the proposal and similar referenda in other states have passed with overwhelming support. That includes <a href="https://time.com/3087608/missouri-electronic-privacy-amendment/">Missouri</a>, which passed a similar amendment in 2014, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_Hampshire_Question_2,_Right_to_Live_Free_from_Governmental_Intrusion_in_Private_and_Personal_Information_Amendment_(2018)">New Hampshire</a>, which passed a related but much broader amendment in 2018.</p>

<p>Local law enforcement officials <a href="https://www.govtech.com/policy/Michigan-Voters-Mull-Electronic-Search-Warrant-Requirements.html">told the Detroit News</a> that they almost always obtain a warrant before searching electronic data and communication. Still, advocates including the amendment’s Republican sponsor and the state ACLU, have said enshrining the protections is an important step forward.—<em>Jamiles Lartey</em></p>
